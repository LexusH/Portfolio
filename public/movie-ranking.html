<h2>My personal favorite films</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Godzilla (2014)</h3>
<p>I love the symbolism of godzilla. A giant monster representing the indiffrent destruction of an atomic bomb</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>The message of needing to strike a balance between progress and nature is really nice. The animation and voice acting are really good</p>
<h3>Lilo and Stitch</h3>
<p>Always loved this movie since I was a kid. The found family trope is strong in this one</p>
